## The Wild Oasis Website

This is a customer-facing website for booking stays in a small boutique hotel with 8 wooden cabins. On this website guests can learn about the hotel, browse all cabins, reserve a cabin, and create and update their profile. This site was built within the React course from Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course).

For this project we choose to use React for front-end; Next.js with 'app' router to handle routing, SSR, data fetching and remote state management; React Server Components Architecture; Context API for UI state management; Supabase to store the data and tailwindCSS for styling. This project was deployed with Vercel.
